# About Me
I am an ecologist with experience in GIS-based spatial analysis and field research, with a focus on conservation, restoration, and ecological monitoring. My work centers on understanding ecological patterns and translating data into information that supports environmental decision-making.
I hold a Master’s degree in Aquatic Ecology and have applied GIS tools to analyze natural communities, assess ecosystem function, and support management and restoration planning. My interests include integrating field-collected ecological data with spatial analysis to understand landscape-level and site-specific processes.

My experience includes ecological field surveys, GPS-based data collection, spatial analysis in ArcGIS Pro, and the development of clear, communicative maps and reports. Additional field experience, including aquatic monitoring and water sampling, is described in the Field Research section of this portfolio.
This portfolio highlights selected GIS projects and field research experiences that reflect my interdisciplinary approach and ongoing professional development.

## Graduate Research: Microplastics in Freshwater Ecosystems

My graduate research focused on the characterization of microplastics and associated contaminants in freshwater systems influenced by suburban development and roadway runoff. This work examined microplastic-associated biofilms and the presence of 6-PPD quinone within a lake–tributary system, with implications for aquatic ecosystem health and management.

The project involved field sampling, laboratory analysis, data interpretation, and collaboration with faculty and research partners. A project overview and public-facing summary are available through Grand Valley State University’s Water Resources Institute.

## Field Research & Ecological Monitoring

I have extensive field experience across freshwater, wetland, and terrestrial systems, supporting ecological research, long-term monitoring, and applied environmental assessment. My field work spans a range of ecological contexts, from Arctic permafrost ponds to urban and suburban lake and watershed systems, and frequently integrates field-collected data with spatial analysis.

### Integration of Field Data & GIS

Field data collected through water sampling, biological surveys, and GPS-based observations were integrated into GIS workflows to support spatial analysis, mapping, and reporting. This integration allowed field observations to inform assessments of ecosystem condition, invasive species distribution, watershed processes, and management priorities.
